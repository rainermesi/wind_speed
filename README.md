# Analyzing historical wind speed data in EU

I was waiting for good wind and decided to look into historic wind speed patterns.

Took a while to find a good public datasource. But I managed to find data for Estonia and some other EU countries. 

I didnt see any immediate trends in windspeed (in Estonia) other than the average windspeed declining in Tallinn over the past 60 years. I suppose this might be due to the city getting bigger and buildings and etc blocking the wind.
